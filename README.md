# Deep Thought

Deep thought is inspired by Thor (http://whatisthor.com/) which is a library for making command line utilities.

In order to user Deep Thought (hereafter 'dt') you need a modern (11+) jdk installation.

Dt is a library that makes it easy to write fast, simple utilities in Java. To do a operation in dt, you'll need a class that:
 - Has an empty constructor
 - Extends Task and implements the abstract methods from Task

Dt comes with a couple of example classes
Ls.java - prints out an ls command from the working directory
Echo.java - echos the command line

"The Universe...!" said Loonquawl.

"And Everything...!"

"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought. "that you're going to like it."
